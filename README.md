### What I learned

For this challenge, I went back to using vanilla JS to see if I can still write it. For the error handling, I tried making cases for every possible errors I could think of and it was pretty exhausting but worth it. The funny thing is that I decided to use SCSS for this project and I didn't even realize I was writing in normal CSS in a SCSS file until the very end. I'm just gonna leave it like that just to remind my future self that he did this.
